# AspProject
This is my first ASP.net project, i aim to make a logon system over a encrypted connection
<<WORK IN PROGRESS!>>

Please note: this project is just a personal challenge i am doing, and it is by no means a secure solution for a logon system.

it also uses a local SQL database, so if you want to make it work, you will have to change the connection strings to suit your own envirnoment

this is probably the biggest project i took on by far, and i set some ambitious goals, so there is no guarantee for success
